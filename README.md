# CleanupTools
Code for organizing, reading, and removing files in a user-friendly way.

The purge_watcher.py and purge_watcher_bash.py python files were constructed for the list of files produced by SciNet on their Niagara supercomputer during monthly purges. The first version was developed for use in a Python environment such as Colab, and the bash version is for use in the terminal. The bash version comes with -h help functionality.
